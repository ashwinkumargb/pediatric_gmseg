**# Pediatric_GMSeg**

Transfer learning to Improve Pediatric Spinal Cord Gray Matter (GM) segmentation. Final project for CS 5267 (Deep Learning, Spring 2022).

**## Summary:**

Current spinal cord GM segmentation methods are trained using adult spinal cord datasets and sub-optimally translate to the pediatric population. This project aims to improves pediatric GM segmentation by conducting transfer learning on a pretrained deep learning model (**sct_deepseg_gm :** [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01269](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01269)) using a clinical pediatric spinal cord dataset. After model evaluation, it was shown that transfer learning does improve pediatric gray matter segmentation.

**## Training Overview**

The following models and data combinations were trained: (1) Pretrained model without data augmentation, (2) Model (no pretraining) without data augmentation, (3) Â Pretrained model with data augmentation, and (4) Model (no pretraining) with data augmentation. The models were trained on the Vanderbilt ACCRE high-performance cluster and the scripts can be found in the accre_scripts directory. The python scripts were designed to take advantage of GPU computing and parallelization for efficiency. ACCRE requires the following python dependency versions to run: Python (v3.6.3), Tensorflow (v1.8.0), Keras (v2.20), CUDA (v11.10).

The datasets used for the models are publicly available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NcCTYn17AmMOj85jrcVG2JA55lBqBiNr?usp=sharing).

## Summary:

Current spinal cord GM segmentation methods are trained using adult spinal cord datasets and sub-optimally translate to the pediatric population. This project aims to improves pediatric GM segmentation by conducting transfer learning on a pretrained deep learning model (*sct_deepseg_gm :* [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01269](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01269)) using a clinical pediatric spinal cord dataset. After model evaluation, it was shown that transfer learning does improve pediatric gray matter segmentation.
